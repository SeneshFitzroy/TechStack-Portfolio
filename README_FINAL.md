  title: "Your Professional Title",
  email: "your.email@example.com"
};

// Add your projects
const projects = [
  {
    title: "Your Project",
    description: "Project description",
    technologies: ["React", "Node.js"],
    github: "https://github.com/username/repo"
  }
];
```

### Visual Themes
Edit `styles/globals.css` for colors and themes:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #3b82f6;
  --secondary-color: #8b5cf6;
  --background-color: #0f172a;
}
```

### 3D Scene Customization
Modify `components/Scene3D.js`:
```javascript
// Adjust particle count
const particleCount = 100; // Default: 100

// Change sphere colors
const sphereColor = "#3b82f6"; // Blue theme
```
